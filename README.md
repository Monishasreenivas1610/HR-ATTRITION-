# HR-ATTRITION-
Employee attrition refers to the deliberate downsizing of a company's workforce. Downsizing happens when employees resign or retire. This type of reduction in staff is called a hiring freeze. It is one way a company can decrease labor costs without the disruption of layoffs. There are a number of reasons why employee attrition takes place.
Attrition can force a firm to identify the issues that may be causing it. It also allows companies to cut down labor costs as employees leave by choice and they're not replaced. Eventually, it can lead to the hiring of new employees with fresh ideas and energy.
